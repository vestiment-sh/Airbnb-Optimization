# Airbnb Optimization

### Getting Started:
1. For the entirity of the project, we'll be using Python on Jupyter Notebook, which can be used by installing the Anaconda Navigator; in addition to being easy to use and offering error feedback, it's also compatible with R if chosen to work with. An alternative IDE is JetBrains' Pycharm, another excellent platform that supports frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Both environments can be found here:
- Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
- JetBrains' PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

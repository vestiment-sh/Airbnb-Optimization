# Airbnb Optimization

The following instructions should be used to guide you in building a functional ETL pipeline using several languages and technologies

### Getting Started:
1. For the entirity of the project, we'll be using Python on Jupyter Notebook, which can be used by installing the Anaconda Navigator; in addition to being easy to use and offering error feedback, it's also compatible with R if chosen to work with. An alternative IDE is JetBrains' Pycharm, another excellent platform that supports frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Both environments can be found here:
- Anaconda Navigator: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
- JetBrains' PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows

2. In order to build our ETL pipeline, we also need a powerful database to upload and warehouse our data, also create the tables with our specifications. We're going to use Google BiqQuery to quickly run our SQL queries and effectively store our data. Being the world's most popular open-source database, MySQL is also a viable option which gives it's users access to several drivers and solid security.
